# OOPM Programing
👨‍💻
Hellow users nice to see you here. I have created this folder of OOPM(Object oriented programming and meathodlogy) 
which, includes lots of interesting program from basic to advance made in pure C++.
To make it more entertaining and redable i had included tonns of comments with emoji.
All the effort in making thid directory goes to me and my OOPM Subject teacher Prof. Nikesh Tiwari(L.N.C.T.S, Bhopal).
All the way of journey he has supported me a lot with a bunch of ideas and logics.
Please, not try to copy just code develop a felling of understanding and logic of implementaion only then you successfull developer.
I will try my best to make changes and add more such files in it.
Suggestion regarding any change in code and ideas are always welcome.👨‍💻

Some personal suggestions-
1) Never skip food.
2) If mind get exausted and stuck fell tired, take a pause walk outside in fresh air come Home and recode.
3) Never judge you to be very good or very bad remember, no one in this world is absolute all are relative.
4) Don't Cheat yourself.
5) Also, if you liked it please leave a star.
          
                                        🥰Enjoy the journey of LIFE!
