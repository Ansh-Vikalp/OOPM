//Nice
// Now we will study second part of polymorphism i.e. Virtual function

    abc obj2;

    p->show();  //â¨˜while child class Pointer can only stores address of it's object.

    p = &obj2;
    p->show();// ðŸ‘‰ Here late binding occurs due to which compiler see what's inside the content inside p.
    //calling of function with help of -> (arrow) operator
