    ğŸ‘Š auto and decltype are two keywords that can automatically jude the type of data assinged to it.
    ğŸ‘Š we need not to give their data type explicitly on using them
    ğŸ‘Š The main difference in use of auto and decltype is that while auto always need to initialised by value
    ğŸ‘Š But decltype need not to be initialised it takes ref. to already declared some variable and use its type to generate itself with same type
    ğŸ‘Š See below example and try to understand.
